# Image Processing in MATLAB
1. Image manipulation techniques such as digital zooming, spatial filtering, and point operations for image enhancement.
2. Noise generation & reduction, fundamen- tals of image enhancement, and restoration concepts
3. Image restoration in frequency domain
4. Frequency domain filters and adaptive spatial domain filters- Inverse filtering and Weiner filtering and Lee filter were compared.
5. Image Compression(DCT transform), K-mean clustering, Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).
