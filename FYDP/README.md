1. MoBIUS: An Alternative to Laptop Touchpads - FYDP Folder


As the usage of laptop computers grows, so too does the amount of people using them away from conventional desks and tables. This leads to scenarios where possessing a laptop is advantageous, such as being able to get a head start on the dayâ€™s work while commuting on the bus, but the user experience while working in such a space- constrained is not always ideal. This is especially true when there is not enough room for a conventional mouse which, for many people, is the preferred choice of input device over a touchpad. MoBIUS is an alternative input device that more closely mimics the operation of a conventional mouse to enhance the user experience when in a space-constrained situation.
